This script demonstrates how to perform time series analysis using the ARIMA model on the Adjusted Closing Price of JPM stock data.

1. Setting Up the Environment:

    The script first installs two R packages: tseries and forecast. These packages are necessary for time series analysis and forecasting.
    It then loads both packages into the R session using the library function.
    Additionally, the script demonstrates how to remove objects from the workspace using the rm function. This helps with cleaning up the environment and avoiding potential conflicts.

2. Data Preparation:

    The script assumes the existence of a data frame named JPM containing an "Adj.Close" column representing the adjusted closing prices.
    It creates a time series object named JPMts from the "Adj.Close" column with a starting date of June 2016 and a frequency of 12 (monthly).
    The script then splits the time series data into training and testing sets. The training set consists of the first 80 data points, while the testing set includes the remaining 5 data points.

3. ARIMA Model Building and Evaluation:

    The auto.arima function is used to automatically identify the optimal parameters for the ARIMA model based on the training data.
    The script then displays a summary of the fitted model using the summary function.
    To check for stationarity in the data, the script performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the log-transformed and differenced training data. Stationarity is a crucial assumption for the ARIMA model.
    The script also plots the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to further analyze the data's characteristics.

4. Fitting and Forecasting:

    The script fits an ARIMA(0,1,0) model to the log-differenced and transformed training data using the Arima function.
    It then displays a summary of the fitted model to explore its parameters and performance.
    The script uses the forecast function to generate 5-step forecasts based on the fitted model.
    The script performs various steps to transform the forecasts back to the original scale and prints the final forecasted values.
    Finally, the script also performs a forecast using the initially fitted ARIMA model (without the data transformation steps) and prints the results for comparison.
